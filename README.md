## Routing
This project uses [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router). The initial setup is a file based router. Which means that the routes are managed as files in `src/routes`.

### Adding A Route

To add a new route to your application just add another a new file in the `./src/routes` directory.

TanStack will automatically generate the content of the route file for you.

Now that you have two routes you can use a `Link` component to navigate between them.

### Adding Links

To use SPA (Single Page Application) navigation you will need to import the `Link` component from `@tanstack/react-router`.

```tsx
import { Link } from "@tanstack/react-router";
```

Then anywhere in your JSX you can use it like so:

```tsx
<Link to="/about">About</Link>
```

This will create a link that will navigate to the `/about` route.

More information on the `Link` component can be found in the [Link documentation](https://tanstack.com/router/v1/docs/framework/react/api/router/linkComponent).

### Using A Layout

In the File Based Routing setup the layout is located in `src/routes/__root.tsx`. Anything you add to the root route will appear in all the routes. The route content will appear in the JSX where you use the `<Outlet />` component.

Here is an example layout that includes a header:

```tsx
import { Outlet, createRootRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'
import { TanStackRouterDevtools } from '@tanstack/react-router-devtools'

import { Link } from "@tanstack/react-router";

export const Route = createRootRoute({
  component: () => (
    <>
      <header>
        <nav>
          <Link to="/">Home</Link>
          <Link to="/about">About</Link>
        </nav>
      </header>
      <Outlet />
      <TanStackRouterDevtools />
    </>
  ),
})
```

The `<TanStackRouterDevtools />` component is not required so you can remove it if you don't want it in your layout.

More information on layouts can be found in the [Layouts documentation](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/react/guide/routing-concepts#layouts).


## Data Fetching

There are multiple ways to fetch data in your application. You can use TanStack Query to fetch data from a server. But you can also use the `loader` functionality built into TanStack Router to load the data for a route before it's rendered.

For example:

```tsx
const peopleRoute = createRoute({
  getParentRoute: () => rootRoute,
  path: "/people",
  loader: async () => {
    const response = await fetch("https://swapi.dev/api/people");
    return response.json() as Promise<{
      results: {
        name: string;
      }[];
    }>;
  },
  component: () => {
    const data = peopleRoute.useLoaderData();
    return (
      <ul>
        {data.results.map((person) => (
          <li key={person.name}>{person.name}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    );
  },
});
```

Loaders simplify your data fetching logic dramatically. Check out more information in the [Loader documentation](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/react/guide/data-loading#loader-parameters).

### React-Query

React-Query is an excellent addition or alternative to route loading and integrating it into you application is a breeze.

First add your dependencies:

```bash
pnpm add @tanstack/react-query @tanstack/react-query-devtools
```

Next we'll need to create a query client and provider. We recommend putting those in `main.tsx`.

```tsx
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from "@tanstack/react-query";

// ...

const queryClient = new QueryClient();

// ...

if (!rootElement.innerHTML) {
  const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(rootElement);

  root.render(
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      <RouterProvider router={router} />
    </QueryClientProvider>
  );
}
```

You can also add TanStack Query Devtools to the root route (optional).

```tsx
import { ReactQueryDevtools } from "@tanstack/react-query-devtools";

const rootRoute = createRootRoute({
  component: () => (
    <>
      <Outlet />
      <ReactQueryDevtools buttonPosition="top-right" />
      <TanStackRouterDevtools />
    </>
  ),
});
```

Now you can use `useQuery` to fetch your data.

```tsx
import { useQuery } from "@tanstack/react-query";

import "./App.css";

function App() {
  const { data } = useQuery({
    queryKey: ["people"],
    queryFn: () =>
      fetch("https://swapi.dev/api/people")
        .then((res) => res.json())
        .then((data) => data.results as { name: string }[]),
    initialData: [],
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <ul>
        {data.map((person) => (
          <li key={person.name}>{person.name}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

You can find out everything you need to know on how to use React-Query in the [React-Query documentation](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/overview).

## State Management

Another common requirement for React applications is state management. There are many options for state management in React. TanStack Store provides a great starting point for your project.

First you need to add TanStack Store as a dependency:

```bash
pnpm add @tanstack/store
```

Now let's create a simple counter in the `src/App.tsx` file as a demonstration.

```tsx
import { useStore } from "@tanstack/react-store";
import { Store } from "@tanstack/store";
import "./App.css";

const countStore = new Store(0);

function App() {
  const count = useStore(countStore);
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => countStore.setState((n) => n + 1)}>
        Increment - {count}
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

One of the many nice features of TanStack Store is the ability to derive state from other state. That derived state will update when the base state updates.

Let's check this out by doubling the count using derived state.

```tsx
import { useStore } from "@tanstack/react-store";
import { Store, Derived } from "@tanstack/store";
import "./App.css";

const countStore = new Store(0);

const doubledStore = new Derived({
  fn: () => countStore.state * 2,
  deps: [countStore],
});
doubledStore.mount();

function App() {
  const count = useStore(countStore);
  const doubledCount = useStore(doubledStore);

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => countStore.setState((n) => n + 1)}>
        Increment - {count}
      </button>
      <div>Doubled - {doubledCount}</div>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

We use the `Derived` class to create a new store that is derived from another store. The `Derived` class has a `mount` method that will start the derived store updating.

Once we've created the derived store we can use it in the `App` component just like we would any other store using the `useStore` hook.

You can find out everything you need to know on how to use TanStack Store in the [TanStack Store documentation](https://tanstack.com/store/latest).

## Type-Safe RPC with Transport Abstraction

This project implements a transport-agnostic, type-safe RPC system for communication between Electron's main and renderer processes. The abstraction allows you to switch between different transports (IPC, WebSocket, HTTP) while maintaining the same type-safe API interface.

### Architecture

The RPC system consists of:

1. **Shared Transport Protocol** (`shared/transport/types.ts`)
   - Message types for invoke requests/responses
   - Event subscription/unsubscription messages
   - Correlation IDs for request/response matching

2. **Transport Implementations**
   - `IpcTransport` - Uses Electron's IPC (default)
   - `WebSocketTransport` - Uses WebSocket for browser/network communication
   - Easily extensible to HTTP, gRPC, etc.

3. **Type-Safe API Creation** (`electron/main/lib/ipc/transport/createApiWithTransport.ts`)
   - Generates type-safe API from definitions
   - Works with any transport implementation
   - Maintains full TypeScript type inference

### Using Different Transports

#### Default: Electron IPC

The default implementation uses Electron's IPC for secure, in-process communication:

```typescript
import { createElectronApi } from './electron/main/lib/ipc/browser'

const api = createElectronApi(...)
```

#### WebSocket Transport

For browser environments or network communication, use WebSocket transport:

**Server (Main Process):**
```typescript
import { startWebSocketServer } from './poc/websocket-server'

const wsServer = await startWebSocketServer(9876)
```

**Client (Renderer/Browser):**
```typescript
import { createWebSocketClient } from './poc/websocket-client'

const { api, transport } = await createWebSocketClient('ws://localhost:9876')
const theme = await api.theme.getTheme()
```

### Security Considerations

When using non-IPC transports:

1. **Localhost Binding**: WebSocket server binds to localhost only by default
2. **Authentication**: Consider adding token-based authentication for production
3. **Origin Checking**: Verify WebSocket connection origins
4. **Method Allowlist**: Limit which APIs are exposed via each transport
5. **Rate Limiting**: Protect against abuse, especially for expensive operations

See `poc/README.md` for detailed security guidelines.

### Serialization Constraints

Different transports have different serialization capabilities:

- **Electron IPC**: Uses Structured Clone algorithm, supports ArrayBuffer, Error, Date
- **WebSocket/HTTP**: Uses JSON serialization
  - ArrayBuffer requires base64 encoding
  - Error objects lose stack traces
  - Date objects become strings

### Proof of Concept

See the `poc/` directory for working examples:
- `websocket-server.ts` - WebSocket RPC server
- `websocket-client.ts` - WebSocket RPC client
- `README.md` - Detailed usage and security documentation

### Testing

The transport abstraction makes testing easier by allowing mock transports:

```typescript
class MockTransport implements RpcTransport {
  async invoke(channel: string, ...args: any[]) {
    return testData[channel]
  }
  subscribe(channel: string, listener: (data: any) => void) {
    return () => {}
  }
}
```

### Design Philosophy

The transport abstraction follows these principles:

1. **Type Safety First**: Full TypeScript type inference across transports
2. **Zero Breaking Changes**: Existing IPC code works unchanged
3. **Transport Independence**: API definitions are transport-agnostic
4. **Easy Testing**: Mock transports for unit testing
5. **Security by Default**: Localhost-only, with clear security guidelines
